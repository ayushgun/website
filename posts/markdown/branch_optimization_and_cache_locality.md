# Branch Prediction Optimization and Cache Locality

> May 20, 2023

High-performance computing has raised the bar for effective hardware resource management. Two key aspects of this paradigm are branch prediction optimization and cache locality. This blog post delivers a brief analysis of these aspects in relation to C++ programs, complete with examples demonstrating suboptimal and optimal usage patterns.

## Branch Prediction

Modern processor architectures, in tandem with sophisticated compilers, utilize a mechanism known as **branch prediction** to prefigure the outcome of conditional branches. This foresight can dramatically enhance program execution speed by circumventing pipeline stallsâ€”a situation that occurs when a branch is incorrectly predicted.

Consider the following C++ code:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (arr[i] > t) {
        process(arr[i]);
    }
}
```

The branching in this loop depends on the data in `arr[]` and the value of threshold `t`, which can be unpredictable, resulting in erroneous branch prediction and the associated pipeline stalls. This issue can be addressed by reorganizing the data in a way that aligns with the branch prediction logic, a technique known as **branch prediction hinting**.

In a scenario where we know in advance that the majority of elements in `arr[]` are likely to be above `t`, we can rearrange the data such that these elements are placed at the beginning of the array:

```cpp
std::partition(arr, arr + n, [t](int a) {
  return a > t;
});

for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (arr[i] > t) {
        process(arr[i]);
    }
}
```

This approach, however, requires prior knowledge about the data and an extra partitioning step, which may not be practical or efficient in all cases. Therefore, it should be applied judiciously.

## Cache Locality

**Cache locality** is a property of a memory reference pattern, where accesses to closely located data are likely to be performed in quick succession. This property manifests in two forms: **spatial locality** and **temporal locality**.

### Spatial Locality

Spatial locality implies that accessing data elements stored closely in memory tends to be beneficial due to the block-based data movement strategies of modern memory hierarchies. This principle is particularly relevant when traversing data structures such as arrays.

Consider this example where a 2D array is traversed in column-major order:

```cpp
for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
        arr[i][j] = i + j;
    }
}
```

This traversal pattern can result in frequent cache misses, negatively impacting performance. A more efficient approach is to traverse in row-major order, aligning with the row-major storage of multidimensional arrays in C++:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
        arr[i][j] = i + j;
    }
}
```

### Temporal Locality

Temporal locality refers to the tendency of the same memory locations to be accessed within short periods. Consider the following C++ example:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    arr[i] = i;
}

for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    arr[i] = func(arr[i]);
}
```

In this example, `arr[i]` is accessed twice, with a substantial interval between the two accesses, which could lead to cache eviction in between, negatively impacting temporal locality. A better approach would be to minimize the interval between accesses to the same memory location:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    arr[i] = func(i);
}
```

In conclusion, while there are various avenues for optimizing branch prediction and cache locality, these strategies should be employed carefully. Performance profiling tools can play a vital role in identifying performance bottlenecks and directing optimization efforts. Always remember that the overhead of optimization should not undermine the benefits in terms of increased complexity or diminished code readability.
