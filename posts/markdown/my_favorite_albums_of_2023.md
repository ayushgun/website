2023 was a year of fresh sounds. Here's a rundown of my favorite albums that transformed those new sounds into cohesive bodies of art.

## The Albums

### 1. UTOPIA - Travis Scott

Travis Scott's "UTOPIA" is an intriguing blend of dark trap beats and smooth singing from guest artists. The gritty rap flows alongside these melodic elements make for a captivating listen.

### 2. Alone at Prom (Deluxe) - Tory Lanez

With "Alone at Prom," Tory Lanez brings back the retro feel in a big way. The album shines with its heartfelt singing and lyrics that tug at the heartstrings.

### 3. A Great Chaos - Ken Carson

Ken Carson’s "A Great Chaos" dives deep into the world of rage music. It’s loud and unapologetic, with heavy distortion and pounding 808s that give off a vibe that'll leave you feeling like a DC villain.

### 4. Afterlyfe - Yeat

Yeat's "Afterlyfe" marks a notable departure from his earlier works. Swapping rage beats for dark psychedelic sounds crafted by BNYX, the album offers catchy flows over deep, mesmerizing production, showing Yeat's evolution as an artist.

### 5. Let's Start Here - Lil Yachty

A radical departure from Lil Yachty's typical style, "Let's Start Here" dives into psychedelic space-rock. The album is a showcase of Yachty’s versatility, featuring impressive autotuned singing and alternative rock influences.

### 6. Heaven knows - Pink Pantheress

Pink Pantheress's "Heaven knows" is a fun, upbeat pop album with a touch of R&B and K-Pop influence. It's vibrant and full of life, with catchy, synth-driven tunes.

### 7. Grails - Pi'erre Bourne

"Grails" by Pi'erre Bourne is a collection of much-anticipated snippets that definitely deliver. The album combines video game-like hip hop beats with guitar elements, all tied together with Pi'erre's signature autotune style.

### 8. Flex Musix - OsamaSon

Similar to "A Great Chaos," OsamaSon's "Flex Musix" is loud and aggressive. While it has a bit of a slow start and rougher production, it stands out with some of the catchiest flows in rage music.

### 9. 5ivestarz - Star Boy

Producer Star Boy's debut full album, "5ivestarz," is an experimental journey through party pop and alternative pop. The album's strength lies in its repetitive yet captivating singing and polished production.

### 10. Heroes & Villains - Metro Boomin

"Heroes & Villains" sees Metro Boomin sticking to his roots with dark trap beats and a lineup of familiar artists. The album is solid, though I’m hoping for more experimentation with collaborations in the future.

## Reflections

This year gave us everything from nostalgic retro bops to classic trap records – and some artists even pushed pop music to new heights. But as we look ahead towards 2024, I think that a futuristic, industrial trap sound is going to take center stage, building on the groundwork laid by Travis Scott's Utopia.
