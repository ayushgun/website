      <h1>Mislabeling Artificial Intelligence</h1>

        Yesterday, I was scrolling through my LinkedIn feed when I came across a
        spreadsheet software startup that claimed to have "harnessed the mighty
        powers" of artificial intelligence to "supercharge" users productivity.
        The post was adorned with buzzwords like "neural networks" and "deep
        learning." Upon examining the software myself, though, what I found was
        a simply a series of basic if-else rules merely mislabeled as artificial
        intelligence.

      <p>
        Over the last year (namely since the release of
        <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>), artificial
        intelligence has often misapplied to technologies that do not embody its
        core principles, such as learning and reasoning. examines the
        technological aspects of AI, identifies common instances of mislabeling,
        and discusses the implications of this misrepresentation on the
        development and perception of AI technologies.
      </p>
      <h2>Cases of Mislabeling</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence aims to create machines capable of intelligent
        behavior, primarily through learning from data, making decisions, and
        improving over time. Despite these clear technological foundations, the
        term AI has been increasingly used to describe a range of technologies
        that do not possess these core attributes. For instance, rule-based
        systems, which operate on predefined rules and heuristics, are often
        mislabeled as AI despite not having the ability to learn or adapt.
        Similarly, basic automation scripts and data analytics, which might
        involve simple statistical analysis or data visualization, are
        incorrectly labeled as AI. Automation can be a component of AI systems
        when it involves decision-making based on learning, but not all
        automation involves AI.
      </p>
      <h2>Technical Implications</h2>
      <p>
        In my opinion, the mislabeling of technologies as AI dilutes the
        understanding of what AI truly represents, leading to confusion and
        misconceptions among the public and stakeholders regarding the
        capabilities of AI systems. This is particularly concerning as it can
        lead to growing unrealistic expectations among the public. The
        misrepresentation of basic technologies as AI can divert attention and
        resources away from real (and exciting!) AI research and development.
        This is detrimental to the progress in the field, as it can lead to the
        misallocation of funding and a lack of focus on areas that are crucial
        for the advancement of AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worst of all, it obscures the ethical and legal considerations that are
        unique to AI systems. For example, bias in machine learning models or
        the interpretability (e.g.,
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)"
          >hallucination</a
        >) of AI decisions are critical issues that need to be addressed. When
        basic technologies are labeled as AI, these considerations are not given
        the attention they require.
