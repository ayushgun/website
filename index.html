        You've reached my site. I'm a Computer Science student at the Georgia
        Institute of Technology concentrating in artificial intelligence and
        system architecture.

        Currently, I am a part of the
        <a href="https://hparch.gatech.edu"
          >High Performance Architecture Lab</a
        >
        at Georgia Tech, where I currently work on developing runtime memory
        saftety solutions using microarchitectural aids.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at
        <a href="https://www.quantillinois.com/">Quant Illinois</a>, a
        quantitative investment and high-frequency trading firm in Chicago. As
        part of the Data team, I developed data query tooling in C++ and Go for
        core research operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm particularly interested in software engineering, low-latency
        systems, and high-performance computing. You can see some of the
        projects I work on at
