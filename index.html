        <h1>Hi, I'm Ayush Gundawar.</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to my site. I am a computer science undergraduate at the
          Georgia Institute of Technology concentrating in artificial
          intelligence and system architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd like to view a summary of my work experience, see my
          <a href="/resume.html">resume</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am a low-latency software engineering intern at one of
          the world's largest liquidity providers, where I develop and research
          high-performance technologies for high-frequency trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I am an undergraduate researcher at the
          <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/"
            >High Performance Architecture Lab</a
          >
          at Georgia Tech, where I am researching novel high-throughput
          allocation policies for in-storage GPU systems in partnership with
          Samsung Research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher on the Even-Tov group at
          the University of California, Berkeley, where I built low-touch
          sentiment analysis pipelines for disclosure indicator classification.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am particularly interested in systems programming, low-latency
          systems, and high-throughput distributed systems. If you'd like to
          read my writings on such topics, see my <a href="/blog.html">blog</a>.
