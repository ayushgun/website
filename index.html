        <p>Hi, I'm Ayush.</p>
        <p>
          I'm a computer science undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of
          Technology concentrating in machine learning and system architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, I was a software engineering intern on a low latency
          systematic trading desk at Citadel Securities, where I worked on
          building systems for market making.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an undergraduate researcher at the High Performance Architecture
          Lab at Georgia Tech, I explored high-throughput GPU allocation
          policies and in-storage GPU architectures in partnership with Samsung
          Research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before that, I was an undergraduate researcher at the Even-Tov group
          of the University of California, Berkeley, where I built low-touch
          sentiment analysis pipelines for disclosure indicator classification.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am particularly interested in systems programming, high performance
          computing for ML, and heterogeneous computing. If you'd like to read
          my writings on these topics, see my blog.
        </p>
