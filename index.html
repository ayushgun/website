        <h1>Hi, I'm Ayush Gundawar.</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome. I am a computer science undergraduate at the Georgia
          Institute of Technology concentrating in machine learning and system
          architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd like to view a summary of my work experience, see my
          <a href="/resume.html">resume</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am a software engineering intern on a low-latency
          systematic trading desk at a market maker, where I work on building
          systems for high-frequency trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I am an undergraduate researcher at the
          <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/"
            >High Performance Architecture Lab</a
          >
          at Georgia Tech, where I am researching high-throughput allocation
          policies for in-storage GPU systems, in partnership with Samsung
          Research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher at the Even-Tov group of
          the University of California, Berkeley, where I built low-touch
          sentiment analysis pipelines for disclosure indicator classification.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am particularly interested in systems programming, low-latency
          systems, and distributed systems. If you'd like to read my writings on
          such topics, see my <a href="/blog.html">blog</a>.
