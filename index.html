          You've reached my site. I'm a Computer Science student at the Georgia
          Institute of Technology concentrating in artificial intelligence and
          system architecture.

          Currently, I am a part of the
          <a href="https://hparch.gatech.edu"
            >High Performance Architecture Lab</a
          >
          at Georgia Tech, where I currently work on developing runtime memory
          saftety solutions using microarchitectural aids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at
          <a href="https://www.quantillinois.com/">Quant Illinois</a>, a
          quantitative investment and high-frequency trading firm in Chicago. As
          part of the Data team, I developed data query tooling in C++ and Go
          for core research operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm particularly interested in software engineering, low-latency
          systems, and high-performance computing. You can see some of the
          projects I work on at
