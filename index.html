          You've reached my site. As you can tell, there is intentially no
          interactive frontend here. Sorry! I primarily use this domain to point to
          various APIs.

          to see what I've been up to.

        <p>
          Currently, I'm a Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of
          Technology concentrating in artificial intelligence and system
          architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at
          <a href="https://www.quantillinois.com/">Quant Illinois</a>, a
          quantitative investment and high-frequency trading firm in Chicago. As
          part of the Data team, I developed data query tooling in C++ and Go
          for core research operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm particularly interested in software engineering, low-latency
          systems, and high-performance computing. You can see some of the
          projects I work on at
          <a href="https://github.com/ayushgun">github.com/ayushgun</a>.
