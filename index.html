					Currently, I'm a Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of
					Technology 🐝 concentrating in artificial intelligence and system
					architecture. 🗄️
				</p>
				<p>
					Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at
					<a href="https://www.quantillinois.com/">Quant Illinois</a>, a
					quantitative investment and high-frequency trading firm in
					Urbana-Champain 🌽. As part of the Data team, I developed order data
					query tooling in C++ for core research infrastructure.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm particularly interested in software engineering, low-latency
					systems, and high-performance computing. You can see some of the
					projects I work on at
					<a href="https://github.com/ayushgun">github.com/ayushgun</a>.

					markets, hip-hop music, or anything else, check out my upcoming
